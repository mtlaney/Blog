    <h1>Hey, I'm Mike Laney</h1>
    <p>This is the blog I built to help me keep track of what I'm up to while learning how to code.</p>
    <p>Right now I'm focusing on Rails, and currently doing the 12 in 12 challenge. Right after this will be more work
      on front end, because we all know, design is great. Follow along with me in this journey, and welcome aboard</p>
    <p>If you'd like to reach out to me on social, and see what I'm up to there, find me on Twitter<a href="http://twitter.com/mtlaney">@mtlaney</a>
      or check out my Github <a href="http://github.com/mtlaney">github.com/mtlaney</a>.</p>
